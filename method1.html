<center>Instant Refunds:
1) Go ahead and contact Amazon
2) Tell them your item is defective, you already tried to fix it by different ways. You asked
your friends, went to a local electronic store etc. Unfortunately the local store confirmed
the defect of the item
3) Now tell them it is extremely urgent, because it was supposed to be a present for your
son. It's his birthday in 2 days already.
4) Now when they ask you to return the item, ask them if there is any way to create an
advanced replacement as it is very urgent and your only possibility to get this item on time.
Tell them you will return the item right away, but you need an advanced replacement to be
processed right now.
5) They should now offer you a free replacement and send you a return label via Email. If
they told you it's not possible, go ahead and act very disappointed and how sad this is from
such a big company. Ask them to check with their supervisor if their system does not allow
an advanced replacement to be processed. If they still decline it close the chat and retry. It
does not work every time, but I can assure you after 3-4 tries it will work. I have done this
on multiple 1000 EUR+ orders.
6) Now if you attempt this on cracked accounts and want to change the shipping address, here is how:
1. When a replacement is created, you only have 1 or 2 minutes to manually change the
address yourself
2. Make sure to add the address to the account already, so you are not losing any time
afterwards.
3. Once the replacement is created, open the order and there you can see a button which
says "edit".
4. Click the button and choose the correct shipping address. That's it.

Make sure not to tell the representative anything!

If you want instant refund you can cancell the replacement from the panel and you will get
refunded automatically. No represetant or supervisor will manually check the refund, but
we still recommend you to go with replacement first and FTID afterwards to avoid rebills
(even tho they usually donâ€™t rebill)

What I personally
recommend:

- Always use a spoofer to call from customer's phone number. Trust me, helps a lot. They
got systems to prevent refunders get easy refunds and this trick will bypass everything.
- Get a photoshoper to do the Police Report. Pretty sure he knows better how to do it and
will guarantee success.
- The trick on FAILED FTID v2 is to add real cop number and cop them in 1-2 hours after
sending Police Report. Always call them upfront with cop's number! Not calling will make
the process so slow.

Info regarding FTIDs:

FTID version 4: This is where you use single side print flyers with an advertisement on it
and place the label(ftid3 label) on the other side (withoud ad)
- typically you would only use this for international orders so it gets through customs
quicker or if you needed faster shipping with say budget shipping labels
- often reffered to as 'advanced' FTID3, but its not really I only use this for international
orders

FTID version 5: Theres like 10 different versions of FTID5 but here is the barcode method:
- Use a barcode generator and add your tracking number to it then replace on label
- create a QR code holding a similar or unreadable tracking number
- it's completely unnessacary to use this method unless you are doing a fake return

FTID version 6.1 (Lost In Transit): Get your label.
Attach to parcel.
Proceed to beat the living fucking shit out of the Parcel.
Send beaten up empty parcel.
Courier will notice the parcel looks like shit and will investigate it further to find out its
empty.
Box will be thrown away.

FTID version 6.2 (Lost In Transit): Use a little bit of glue on the label. Roll up the corners or
edges and then hope it gets lost in transit
Or use double sided tape and hope it gets caught on another surface after it gets scanned.
Box will be thrown away.
This is how FTID version 3 looks if you don't know how it looks and how to edit FTID
version 3:
